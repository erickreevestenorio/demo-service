Demo Service

Create a main SpringBoot gradle project (output as war file) having controller with two REST methods (A and B). 
Autowire the bean from jarA and the bean from jarB. 
Finally call "A" bean's method from REST method "A" and call "B" bean's method from REST method "B". 
You can use gradle to set dependencies to project A and B from main project.
